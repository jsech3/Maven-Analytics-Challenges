## About the dataset for this project:
* This dataset contains 2 tables in CSV format
* The Resorts table contains information on 499 ski resorts around the world, including their location, slopes, lifts, prices, and ski season
* The Snow table contains supplemental data on the surface of the earth covered by snow for each month in 2022, by latitude & longitude

For this project, I chose to use a combination of SQL, Power BI, and Python to get my results. I thought it was cool that many of these resorts offered Summer and even sometimes Night skiing. It's awesome to dig deeper into the data and get a better understanding of the WHY!
